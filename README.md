# NextJS OpenJira App

This project is a Jira clone, which is a project management tool that allows users to track and manage tasks and issues throughout the software development process. This Jira clone was developed using Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building web applications, TypeScript, a statically-typed programming language, and Material UI, a library of pre-designed React components that make it easy to create attractive and responsive user interfaces.
